# Advent Of Code

These are my attempts at the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges.

While I primarily use .NET/C# for solving these as that is my primary language, I
might circle back and use these challenges to learn other languages.

The code created here is not meant to be a well architected solution to each problem,
but rather an exercise in getting an answer to a solution. If the problem is particularly
interesting to me, I might circle back later and create a variation of my original solution.
